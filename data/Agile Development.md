**1. How does the Agile model compare to the Waterfall model?**  
  Agile is...
  * More resilient, flexible, able to respond  
  * Suited to work that is uncharted  
  * Allows for players to deepen understanding of project needs and respond to constraints based on best, most recent information  

**2. Why do you think Agile is so popular in software development?**  
  Software is developed for clients (business people) by software developers to be used by users. While each group can have some insight into the others' needs from the beginning, it is impossible for each group to understand the needs, behaviors, and constraints of the other groups. As an iterative process, Agile development allows these three groups to deepen their understanding and ability to respond to each others needs based on successive interactions.   
  
**3. Do you think Agile is applicable in all industries?**  
  No. In areas where the needs and environment are static or perfectly known, Agile is not necessary and may even be costly. Culturally, agile development may not be a good fit in many organizations.
